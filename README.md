# Diabetes_Prediction
Predicting whether the patient is diabetic or not using Machine Learning models. We have trained 90% of the dataset and the tested 10% of the dataset.

Machine Learning models used:
1) Random Forest Classifier (Highest Accuracy for Classification Problems)
2) Gradient Boosting Classifier (Constant Accuracy)

Accuracy of our Random Forest model:
1) Minimum: 81.52 %
2) Maximum: 87.11 %

Accuracy of our Gradient Boosting Classifier model: 85.714 %
